## 1.4 Networks

- **Layered Network Architectures (L2/L3)**: To manage network traffic, CityVision AI uses a layered network approach, with Layer 2 handling local data center traffic and Layer 3 managing data routed across locations. This setup facilitates efficient load balancing and data distribution across regions.

- **Network Virtualization and Overlay Networks**: To securely connect various components of the platform, overlay networks are used. Network virtualization enables CityVision AI to segment video data traffic by region, client, and purpose, ensuring data security and compliance.

- **High-Performance Computing (HPC) in Data Centers**: The video analytics processing demands high computational power. CityVision AI’s main data centers use HPC clusters to quickly analyze video feeds and feed insights back to city management authorities in real time.

## 1.5 Storage on-Prem, Storage on the Cloud

- **Block, Object, and File Storage**: Video data and analytics results are stored in a hybrid storage setup. Raw video footage, requiring high-speed access, is stored as block storage. Processed analytics data is stored as object storage, while configuration files and reports are stored in a file storage system.

- **Storage Area Networks (SAN) vs. Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: A SAN supports high-speed storage for video data due to its high performance. NAS is used for non-critical, file-based workloads like storing logs, allowing a cost-effective distribution of storage resources.

- **Hybrid Storage Solutions**: CityVision AI uses a hybrid model where frequently accessed data remains on-premises for speed, while historical data is archived in the cloud for long-term storage.

- **Distributed File Systems**: Distributed file systems like Ceph provide redundancy and scalability, ensuring that video data is accessible across all data centers, supporting failover and load balancing.

---

## 1.6 Virtual Machines and Networks in the Cloud

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Architecture**: CityVision AI uses a VPC for each city’s deployment, creating isolated environments that support secure video data management. This isolation ensures data privacy and regulatory compliance.

- **VM Provisioning and Orchestration**: As new cities are added to the platform, the provisioning of VMs is automated for rapid setup. Orchestration tools ensure efficient resource allocation, avoiding downtime when expanding to additional regions.

- **Cloud Network Isolation and Segmentation**: CityVision AI’s VPC setup uses network segmentation to separate different traffic types, such as video analysis, storage, and reporting. This keeps analytics traffic isolated from administrative functions.

## 1.7 Containers in the Cloud (with Kubernetes Management)

- **Kubernetes Architecture**: To streamline containerized microservices (e.g., for AI processing, data ingestion, API management), CityVision AI employs Kubernetes, which handles load distribution across worker nodes, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

- **Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)**: CNIs enable the containerized microservices to communicate securely and efficiently. This is essential for integrating various components, such as analytics engines and data storage.

- **Service Mesh**: A service mesh like Istio enables secure and monitored communication between microservices, which is critical for inter-service communication in this multi-tenant environment.

- **Cluster Federation for Multi-cloud Kubernetes**: With deployments across different regions and cloud providers, cluster federation allows CityVision AI to manage clusters in multiple clouds, providing flexibility and disaster recovery options.

## 1.8 Applications in the Cloud

- **Microservices vs. Monolithic Architectures**: CityVision AI’s platform is built on microservices, which allows each functional component (e.g., video ingestion, analytics, alerting) to scale independently, meeting diverse city demands.

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Each region (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) has its own deployment to reduce latency and meet local compliance. Data is processed regionally, improving response times for real-time applications.

- **Application Scaling & High Availability**: Applications are configured for automatic scaling to handle fluctuating data loads, such as increased video uploads during major events. Load balancers ensure that each instance remains available, even during traffic spikes.
