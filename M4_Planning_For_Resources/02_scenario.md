## **Industry Scenario: Scaling for a Major Sales Event**

### **Context:**
The engineering team at **ShopStar**, a large e-commerce platform, is gearing up for its biggest sales event of the year, which is expected to bring a 300% increase in site traffic. To ensure optimal performance, they must plan and allocate resources, manage data transfer reliability, and employ sustainable practices. 

This scenario requires a blend of **capacity planning**, **layered capacity management**, **data transfer reliability**, and **sustainability efforts** to handle the spike in traffic while maintaining reliability and minimizing environmental impact.

### **Step 1: Capacity Planning**

#### **Calculating Capacity for CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage**
1. **Data Gathering and Analysis**:
   - **Historical Data Review**: The team reviews last year’s metrics, which show a 250% traffic increase during the sales event, analyzing CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage use patterns.
   - **Predictive Modeling**: Using AI-driven capacity planning tools, they simulate a 300% increase in load. This model helps identify bottlenecks, particularly on product and checkout pages, where demand surges are anticipated.

2. **Planning with Headroom**:
   - The model advises a **50% buffer** above anticipated peak usage to account for unexpected spikes. They calculate resource requirements per service (e.g., inventory, payment, recommendations) and adjust scaling thresholds.

#### **Performance Tuning and Optimization**
3. **Optimization Steps**:
   - **Database Optimization**: The team tunes database indexes on high-frequency queries (product recommendations, checkout) and caches these results in memory for faster retrieval.
   - **Application Profiling**: They profile the app end-to-end, using tools like **Jaeger for distributed tracing**, to identify bottlenecks, particularly in API response times, which are optimized to handle higher traffic.

4. **Pre-event Load Testing**:
   - They conduct **stress tests** simulating up to 400% of average load to test application performance under extreme conditions. This helps adjust scaling policies and test the efficiency of caches and load balancers.

### **Step 2: Capacity Management at Different Layers**

#### **Application Layer Scaling (Auto-scaling, Horizontal vs Vertical)**
5. **Application Layer Resilience**:
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: They set up auto-scaling groups for critical microservices (e.g., inventory management, recommendations) with additional instances that scale horizontally.
   - **Predictive Auto-scaling**: Based on the AI-driven capacity model, they implement predictive auto-scaling, enabling the infrastructure to pre-scale during anticipated traffic surges.

6. **Tricks and Tips**:
   - **Efficient Load Balancing**: They deploy a mix of **weighted load balancing** and **traffic routing** across multiple regions. This minimizes latency and improves user experience, particularly for international customers.

#### **Network Bandwidth and Throughput Management**
7. **Network Optimization**:
   - **Traffic Shaping**: To prioritize payment-related traffic, they use **traffic shaping**, ensuring checkout processes are given higher priority over browsing requests.
   - **Edge Caching**: By leveraging CDN edge nodes, they cache static resources like product images near customer locations, reducing bandwidth and load on core servers.

8. **Advanced Tip**:
   - **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**: They use SDN policies to dynamically allocate bandwidth based on real-time demand and reroute network traffic to avoid congestion.

#### **Disk I/O and Storage Tiering**
9. **Storage Strategy**:
   - **Tiered Storage**: Critical data (inventory, payment processing) is stored on high-speed SSDs, while less frequently accessed data (e.g., old product images) is stored on lower-cost, cold storage.
   - **Database Sharding**: The team sharded the database by geographical region, distributing the I/O load evenly to prevent bottlenecks and improve read/write speeds during high demand.

10. **Advanced Storage Tip**:
   - **Multi-region Storage Replication**: For reliability, they implement real-time replication of high-priority data across regions to enable immediate failover if needed.

### **Step 3: Ensuring Reliability in Data Transfer**

#### **Data Transfer Protocols (HTTP/2, QUIC, gRPC)**
11. **Choosing Optimal Protocols**:
   - **Protocol Selection**: The team uses **HTTP/2** for static assets (images, scripts) to benefit from multiplexing, while internal microservices communicate via **gRPC**, ensuring low-latency, efficient communication.
   - **Fallback to QUIC**: They set up **QUIC** as a backup protocol for essential services, such as inventory updates, to ensure continued low-latency service even if network congestion occurs.

#### **Ensuring Consistency (CAP Theorem, BASE, ACID)**
12. **Data Consistency Approach**:
   - **Hybrid Consistency Models**: For cart and checkout services, the team ensures **ACID compliance** for transaction integrity, while inventory data, which is frequently updated but can tolerate slight delays, uses **BASE**.
   - **Optimizing Consistency in High-Traffic**: During peak hours, they allow eventual consistency for non-critical data (e.g., recommendations) to reduce load on the primary database.

13. **Tip**:
   - **CAP-aware Architecture**: They architect the system to handle trade-offs between consistency and availability dynamically, ensuring critical services remain available during spikes.

#### **Data Integrity and Checksums**
14. **Integrity Verification**:
   - **Checksums** are added to all data transferred during critical processes, such as payment, ensuring data integrity even under high load.
   - **Automated Re-checks**: They use an automated verification mechanism that periodically checks stored data integrity and resolves discrepancies if detected.

15. **Advanced Tip**:
   - **Real-time Integrity Checks**: They deploy integrity checks on critical database tables (e.g., user cart items) to ensure no data corruption under load.

### **Step 4: Sustainability Practices**

#### **Energy Efficiency in Data Centers**
16. **Power Management**:
   - They use a **power optimization tool** that powers down non-essential servers during low demand periods, conserving energy in line with predicted usage patterns.
   - **AI-based Power Allocation**: The AI system dynamically allocates power and cooling based on server workloads, optimizing energy use and reducing the data center’s carbon footprint.

#### **E-Waste and Recycling of Hardware**
17. **Sustainable Hardware Strategy**:
   - Any new hardware is sourced through a **certified e-waste recycling partner**. Additionally, hardware components are repurposed whenever possible, reducing the need for new equipment.

#### **Carbon Footprint Management**
18. **Carbon Offsets and Efficient Operations**:
   - To further offset the environmental impact of their increased server load, the company invests in **carbon offset programs**. Additionally, they prioritize renewable energy sources for powering data centers.

19. **Rare Tip**:
   - **Geo-location Optimization for Carbon Reduction**: By scheduling high-energy workloads (e.g., data backups) in locations with renewable energy during off-peak hours, they minimize carbon emissions.
